 MVC   - Model View Controller
                |
                |
 MV-VM - Model View (View-Model)
 
 
 What is MVC?
 
 In MVC,
 
 MVC Components Definitions
    1. Model stores data.
    2. View is the visual presentation of data.
    3. Controller allows communication between Model and View.
 
 Components Relationships
    4. Model and View never communicate directly with each other.
    5. Controller can access Model.
    6. Model can never talk to Controller.
    7. Controller can keep outlet of a View. Or a controller can create Views using UIKit programmatically.
    8. View cannot talk to controller without Target Action Pattern (IBAction) or selector functions.
 
 MVC Related Features
    9. In MVC projects, Networking takes place inside Controller.
 
    Note*: Target Action is same as IBAction (Interface Builder Action). Only difference is that Target Action is used programmatically and is triggered through selector functions.
